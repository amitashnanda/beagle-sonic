# Namely it doesn't actually configure the pins

# Instead do it with universal overlays and config-pin
# Grabs the needed pins under a universal overlay so config-pin can touch them
# Assumes needed universal overlay is loaded. If not, config-pin can do it.
# If doing so, add the overlay before the pin configs.
