# Beagle-Sonic Anemometer
This project aims to create Anemometer, which is a device used for measurement of wind velocity,they can be of different types, for ex. Cup Anemometer is the most widespread and common type, given its long history and simple mechanism.

However, UltraSonic Anemometer are superior than Anemometer using mechnical parts, because it is not affected by environmental conditions.You can find more about it by simple digging across google.

Started with GSoC-2016, once completed would prove a great open-source project for amateur and anybody intrested in weather science.


This Repository is under development hence frequent changes are obvious and you can refer wiki https://github.com/thetransformerr/beagle-sonic/wiki for latest development.

Thanks!!
